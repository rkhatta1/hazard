Design systems have evolved from simple style guides to complex ecosystems that power enterprise applications. But what's next?

## The AI Revolution

With the advent of generative AI, we're seeing a shift in how components are generated and maintained. Instead of manually writing every variant, we can now define rules and let AI handle the permutations.

- **Automated Documentation**: No more stale docs.
- **Self-healing Components**: Styles that adapt to context.
- **Personalized UI**: Interfaces that morph based on user preference.

> "The best design system is one that you don't even know you're using."

## Tokenization 2.0

We are moving beyond simple color tokens. We are now tokenizing motion, sound, and even haptic feedback. This creates a truly immersive experience across all devices.

### What this means for developers

1. Learn to think in systems, not pages.
2. Embrace tools that abstract low-level styling.
3. Focus on accessibility and inclusivity from day one.
